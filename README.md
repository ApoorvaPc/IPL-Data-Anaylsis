#IPL Data Analysis

Description:

As a new season of IPL starts I want to present my Analysis and Visualization of the past 13 seasons. 
IPL is a twenty20 cricket league, played by teams representing different Indian Cities. It started in 2008 and is played annually.
As an IPL fan, I wanted this to be my first Mini-project to start my Data Analysis Journey.

I wanted to take advantage of the integration of Python, SQL, and Tableau.

To pre-process the dataset a tool like Python (Jupyter notebook) which has a substantial amount of Math and Statistical Tools is helpful. 

And to have a high database management level, I’ll be using SQL. it’s a more secure place to store data, so later it would be easier to manipulate the Database and extract meaningful information. I’ll be using MySQL the most popular version of SQL.

Finally, Tableau presents results in the most intuitive way and quickly creates sharp visualization.
Here I use CSV files to transfer data between the tools.

Objective of the Project:

The objective of this project is to look back and reflect on previous performance, answer simple questions like:
     
     1.Is it better to Bowl or Bat first at a particular Venue?
     
     2.How has each team performed over the years? 
     
     3.Does a Bowler’s Economy Rate affect his wicket-taking ability? 
     
     4.What are the types of dismissals and which is the most common one?
     
     5.Who are the Orange and Purple cap holders for each year and among them who concede the highest Runs and Wickets?

 

The Final Tableau Visualization with Observation can be found on Tableau Public.
